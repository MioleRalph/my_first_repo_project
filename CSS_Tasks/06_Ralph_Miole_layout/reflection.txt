In cloning the Bootstrap landing page, 
my approach was to first analyze the layout and break it into sections such as the navbar, 
hero section, and content areas. I struggled most with matching the spacing, alignment, and responsiveness of the design. 
I overcame this by using the Inspect tool in Google Chrome to examine styles and by reviewing our recent Bootstrap topics, 
especially the grid system and utility classes. The assignment took me around 3–4 hours to complete. 
This experience helped me better understand how Bootstrap layouts are built and styled.
